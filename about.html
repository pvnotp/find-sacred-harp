What are Sacred Harp Singings?
</div>

<div class="answer">
Sacred Harp Singings are events where people join to sing songs from <i>The Sacred Harp</i> and other songbooks.  There is no audience or rehersal; singers participate simply for the joy of it.  More information about sacred harp singing can be found at <a href="http://fasola.org">fasola.org</a>.
</div>

<div class="question">
Where does the information for this site come from?
</div>

<div class="answer">
Information on singing events was taken from the <i>Minutes and Directory of Sacred Harp Singings</i>.  Some of the locations have been changed so that they are easier for Google Maps to understand, but I have done my best to make sure they are still accurate.  Links to websites for singings were sourced from fasola.org, and sometimes just my own searching.  Thank you to everyone who submits their event information to the minutes, and who maintains local singing information online.

<div class="question">
Why don't you list the times of events?
</div>

<div class="answer">
Since information for events is subject to change, I wanted to encourage people to find more up-to-date information on singings they wish to attend.  This site is simply intended to make it easier to narrow down which singings are available near your location.

<div class="question">

</div>

<div class="answer">
Sure.  Just email me the correct info at <a href="mailto:alisonjoyforster@gmail.com">alisonjoyforster@gmail.com</a>.
